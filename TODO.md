WHAT TO DO NEXT
• Fix, or improve the appearance of, the loading delay for the first dog upon app start up
   • Or set a static default image that will quickly load, like the Unsplash one
• Round the corners of the extension popup
• Add space between button and photo frame
• Add title background oval
• Publicly deploy on the Web Store

STRETCH GOALS
• Add dynamic alt-text changes with the breed of each dog for photos
• Any way to restrict images to filter ones with only dogs?
• Allow users to filter by their favorite dog breed
• Allow users to switch between the Dogs.ceo API and thedogAPI (thecatapi)

DONE
• Auto load the first dog
• Frame and button styling
• Set up Chrome developer account
• Build the basic extension

UNRELATED STRETCH GOALS
• Other "random ______ generator" extension ideas? Can use the exact same code and just change the API and a bit of the styling
   • Cat
   • Taco
   • Plane, Train, or Car
   • Mountain
   • Hiking trail
